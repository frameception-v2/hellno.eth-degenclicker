# DegenClicker Technical Specification

## 1. OVERVIEW

### Core Functionality
- Clicker game with ðŸŽ© emoji as primary collectible
- Manual click mechanics with haptic feedback
- Auto-collector system with 3 upgrade tiers:
  1. Jacek Founders (max 5 units)
  2. Hat Factories
  3. Crypto Conferences
- Exponential cost curve for upgrades
- Real-time counter animation with floating +1 indicators
- Cyberpunk visual theme with purple/neon color palette

### UX Flow
1. Initial view: Central animated ðŸŽ© with counter overlay
2. Click/tap interaction triggers particle effect
3. Side panel for upgrade purchases (slide-in on mobile)
4. Progressively revealed upgrade tiers
5. Auto-collection counter updates with visible floating +N indicators
6. Achievement notifications for milestone unlocks

## 2. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
